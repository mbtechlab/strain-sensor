## Overview
_*Wearable strain sensors have garnered considerable attention due to their potential applications in tracking human activities. Despite recent developments, challenges remain in terms of achieving high stretchability, rapid response/recovery times, and most significantly mechanical stability. Furthermore, the ease of fabrication and cost-effectiveness of these sensors are important to facilitate large-scale adoption in various industries. Addressing these challenges will enable more accurate and reliable tracking for numerous applications. In this study, we have developed a highly mechanically reliable and stretchable crack-based resistive strain sensor by metallizing a Kapton polyimide (PI).  Ni as the sensing material, is deposited using electroless plating in a Ni-P bath and patterned in serpentine shape before being embedded in silicone rubber (SR). The fabricated sensor exhibits a gauge factor of up to 0.92, stretchability over 120%, and mechanical stability of 2250 cycles at 40% strain. The response and relaxation delays of 200 ms and 110 ms, respectively, enable the sensor to detect sudden changes. As a proof of principle, the sensor is attached to the wrist, arm and abdomen, to monitor their corresponding motions. The sensor's performance in these applications highlights its potential, applicable in healthcare and rehabilitation, sports tracking and human-machine interface (HMI) applications.*_

## Project description:
This project focuses on the development a highly reliable and stretchable crack-based resistive strain sensor for wearable applications. It is fabricated by using a cost-effective electroless plating process for metallizing Kapton PI film with a nickel-phosphorous (Ni-P) layer. The sensor incorporates a unique island-bridge structure that enhances stretchability, mechanical stability,  fast response/recovery and electrical performance, while maintaining high sensitivity. 

The strain sensor is embedded within silicone rubber (SR) elastomer, ensuring flexibility and durability, making it suitable for use on curvilinear body surfaces.
The satisfactory crystallization of Ni grains and dense contact between grains are verified using Map and XRD analysis of the surface before and after the fatigue test. 

We have shown that this strain sensor can reliably monitor human health and motion such as wrist and arm movements and can be assembled on the abdomen to monitor respiratory activity. These strain sensors an ideal candidate for monitoring daily human activities involve movements of various limbs, muscles and joints. 


## Key Features
* __High Stretchability:__ Thin film and curvlinear structure is adopted to the surface of skin and can stretches and flexes upon applying strain. The strain sensor can stretch up to 120%, making it suitable for a wide range of wearable applications that require flexible and conformable materials.

* __Mechanical Stability:__ The sensor demonstrates excellent mechanical durability, withstanding over 2250 cycles at 40% strain without failure. Its innovative island-bridge structure and Kapton polyimide  support as well as quality and chemical of deposited layer contribute to superior fatigue resistance.

* __High Sensitivity:__ The cauliflower-like structure of the electroless-Ni has delivered improved responsivness to strain and the large area enable more contact between the conducting particles, and resulting the sensor exhibits a gauge factor high sensitivity to even small deformations, and can detect strains as low as 1%.

* __Cost-Effective Fabrication:__ The sensor is fabricated using electroless nickel plating, a cost-effective and scalable process that ensures uniform deposition and excellent electrical conductivity, suitable for mass production.

* __Real-Time Monitoring and Wearable Compatibility:__ The sensor is designed to be integrated into wearable devices, such as wristbands, arm cuffs, or chest straps, making it ideal for health monitoring, rehabilitation, sports tracking, and human-machine interface applications.
